# cf-pagination

Basic pagination styling.
This component can be used by itself, but it was made for Capital Framework,
a new front end framework developed at the
[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://cfpb.github.io/).

(Includes [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for icons until the CFPB icon
font is released.)

If you would like to take advantage of more components or if you're new to
Capital Framework, we encourage you to [start here](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/).
